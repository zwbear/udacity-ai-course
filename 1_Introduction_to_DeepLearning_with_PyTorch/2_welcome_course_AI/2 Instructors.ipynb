    "Mat is the product lead for Udacity's School of AI and a former content developer as well. He received his PhD in physics from UC Berkeley where he spent most of his time as an experimental neuroscientist. During that time, he gained a love of Python, machine learning, neural networks, and Bayesian statistics. At Udacity, Mat has built courses on Hadoop, data visualization, Python tools such as Conda and Jupyter, and deep learning.\n",
